Every subscriber should be able to listen for server events and interact with the Slack client. The Slack client provides {@link external:slackapi|several apis} for interaction:

  - The Events API is gaining some traction and may end up replacing the RTM API, but it does not seem feature complete yet so it is omitted. Instead, the RTM API is used which utilizes websockets for incoming messages.
  - To use slash commands in Slack, a webhook is required so that slack can send POST requests to that hook with information about the message in which the defined slash command is used.
  - Interactive messaging includes buttons, message menus, and dialogs. Slack allows for a separate webhook to be defined in case those interactions need to be dealt with separately. By default, the slackbot expects a separate URI to be provided for these interactions.
  - Options loading comes in handy for dynamic population of options when using `select` element types in interactive messaging. Slack requires a webhook for these interactions as well.

So there are three separate hooks that a slack app can use! As such, these are all accounted for in a `Subscriber`. You can, of course, omit any of them in your Slack config, but it is not recommended to use the same URI for any two hooks. This should/will be rectified in a future update.


### Interface Methods For A Subscriber
When extending from a `Subscriber`, there are two methods which are important to note. See comments below for details:
```
class MySubscriber extends Subscriber {
  // NOTE: overriding this method is OPTIONAL.
  // if you have custom processors for your own webhooks or other models that
  // need to be available to other subscribers/processors via the registry,
  // you should register them here. this is also where you add your own
  // collection processors to the subscriber. do NOT attempt to access any of
  // four collection processors included for all subscribers as they have not
  // yet been registered. that means that any processors you plan to add to
  // them will not be available in the registry. a pre-scoped `Registry`
  // instance is provided as the only param for convenience.
  register(registry) {
    // these are ready to go, but you probably won't need them here unless
    // you architect models that need them as arguments in their constructors
    const server = registry.global('WebServer');
    const db = registry.get('db'); // if you configured one
    const slack = registry.get('Slack');

    // you can add your own collection processor
    this.addCollectionListener(CustomWebhookListenerGroup);

    // you can register your own models/processors (this one happens to
    // need the db instance)
    registry.set(new CustomModel(db));

    // or register whatever
    registry.set('importantOpts', { areBelongToUs: true });

    // pre-configured collection processors are `undefined` at the moment
    this.rtmListenerGroup.add(MyRTMListener); // error
  }

  // NOTE: overriding this method is MANDATORY!
  // this is where you should add your individual processors. this is also
  // the place to tell the server to listen for requests from 3rd party
  // webhooks. if this block gets to be a bit lengthy, you can add methods
  // to the class and then call them from here. again, a `Registry` instance
  // is provided as a param for convenience.
  subscribe(registry) {
    const server = registry.global('WebServer'); // needed to register custom webhooks
    const customModel = registry.get('CustomModel'); // if ya need it

    // add appropriate custom processors you want in your custom collection processor
    this.customWebhookListenerGroup.add([
      MyBasicWebhookListener,
      MyAdvancedWebhookListener,
    ]);

    // add processors to pre-configured, common collection processors
    this.rtmListenerGroup.add(MyRTMListener);

    // setup custom webhooks
    server.on('/my/custom/webhook', ({ headers, data, response }) => {
      this.customWebhookListenerGroup.process({ data });
    });
  }
}
```


### Gimmies When Adding A New Subscriber

Let's look at what happens when a new subscriber is added to a `SlackBot` instance (e.g. `mySlackBot.addSubscriber(MySubscriber)`):
```javascript
// we get a lot of stuff from the registry, which is provided to the
// initialization method (which contains this "bootstrap" code) by the SlackBot
const server = registry.global('WebServer');
const slack = registry.get('Slack');

// we need the config for a slack app so we can grab these hooks
const { interactiveUri, optionsLoadUri, slashCommandUri } = slack._config;

// run this first to ensure that no collection processors can be
// accessed within the method. helps enforce separation of concerns..
this.register(registry);

// adds instances of these collection processors to the subscriber, with
// the property as a camelCased version of the class name
this.addListenerCollections([
  InteractionListenerGroup,    // meant to process interactive messages
  OptionsListenerGroup,        // meant to process options load requests
  RtmListenerGroup,            // meant to process rtm messages (EVERY message)
  SlashCommandListenerGroup,   // meant to process slash command requests
]);

// if your slack app has a slash command configured, the uri should be added
// to your config. if you created and added any slash command processors,
// they will be sent every message received by this hook.
if (slashCommandUri) {
  server.on(slashCommandUri, ({ headers, data, response }) => {
    this._log.json(`just saw a request from ${slashCommandUri}: `, data);
    if (this.slashCommandListenerGroup.length) {
      const message = new SlackMessage({ message: data });
      return this.slashCommandListenerGroup.process({ headers, message, response });
    }
  });
}

// if your slack app has interactive messaging enabled, the uri should be added
// to your config. if you created and added any interaction processors,
// they will be sent every message received by this hook.
if (interactiveUri) {
  server.on(interactiveUri, ({ headers, data, response }) => {
    this._log.json(`just saw a request from ${interactiveUri}: `, data);
    if (this.interactionListenerGroup.length) {
      const message = new SlackMessage({ message: data });
      return this.interactionListenerGroup.process({ headers, message, response });
    }
  });
}

// if your slack app uses dynamic options for select elements, the uri should be added
// to your config. if you created and added any options processors,
// they will be sent every message received by this hook.
if (optionsLoadUri) {
  server.on(optionsLoadUri, ({ headers, data, response }) => {
    this._log.json(`just saw a request from ${optionsLoadUri}: `, data);
    if (this.optionsListenerGroup.length) {
      const message = new SlackMessage({ message: data });
      return this.optionsListenerGroup.process({ headers, message, response });
    }
  });
}

// if your slack app prefers interacting with rtm messages, and if you created
// and added any rtm processors, they will be sent every message received
// by this hook.
slack.rtmClient.on('message', (rtmMessage) => {
  // logging omitted because there would BE SO MANY
  if (this.rtmListenerGroup.length) {
    const message = new SlackMessage({ message: rtmMessage });
    return this.rtmListenerGroup.process({ message });
  }
});

// implementors MUST set their hooks in this method
this.subscribe(registry);
```

These hooks are utilized for every subscriber (if defined in the config) because it is an inclusive list of all hooks provided for a Slack app. You may have noticed that the `register()` method is called before the common collection processors are added, reinforcing the previous example above. You can also see that the last thing that happens is a call to the `subscribe()` method, which is the one **you will have to implement**.

Let's check out how to implement your first processor in [the next section]{@tutorial 4-your-first-processor}.
